The code deconvolutes DTG peaks by using a global search method.

The DTG contains two peaks and a non-zero peak tail. For the deconvolution, distributaed activation energy model is used.
This model assumes that there are three different kinetics going on for the 1st, 2nd peak and non-zero-peak tail.
It also assumes that each kinetics can be approximated by an average pre-factor value and the activation energy
for that kinetics is normally distributed.

In order to decovolute the peak and get the prefactors and activation energy distibutions, deconvolution of 
the first peak is necessary. For that, the temperature range has tobe chosen in such a way that only the major portion of the
first peak lies in that range. Once, we obtain the parameters for the first peak, we need to put that in the 
deconvolution of the second peak. Here we will choose the temperture range of 1st and 2nd peak. Once, we obtain 
the parameters for the 2nd peak, we will put these parameters along with the 1st peak parameters for deconvolution
of peak tail.

The matrix BBBB contains all the parameters for the optimization. There are 12 parameters in total for the optimization of 3 
lumped reactions. They are stoichiometric parameter, logarithm 10 of prefactor, average of activation energy
distribution, andstandard deviation of activation energy distribution.

The input txt file has 5 columns, they are time, temperature, % wt, DTG and DSC data. Only the temperature and DTG data 
are sufficient to run this code.
